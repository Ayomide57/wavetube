# WaveTube

WaveTube is the first decentralized streaming platform like YouTube. It leverages polkadot and integration with Apillon, IPFS, transparent, and user-centric platform for content creators and consumers. WaveTube addresses critical issues of high fees, lack of content ownership, and stringent regulations found in traditional video streaming platforms by utilizing the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.

## What's the Problem WaveTube Solves?
1. **High Fees and Centralization:** Traditional video streaming platforms charge high fees (e.g., 40% for YouTube superchats) and maintain centralized control, impacting content ownership and revenue distribution.
2. **Lack of Ownership:** Content on centralized platforms is owned by the platform itself, not the creators, leading to potential censorship and loss of revenue.
3. **Strict Regulations:** Platforms like YouTube impose strict content regulations, leading to potential bans and demonetization for creators.

## Key Features and Technologies:
1. **Apillon Integration:**
- **Secure Social Logins:** WaveTube uses Apillon Open Authentication (OAuth) to ensure users can securely log in using decentralized identity (DID) stored on the KILT blockchain. This enhances privacy and security, making onboarding seamless and protecting user data from unauthorized access.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** By utilizing Apillon Open Authentication (OAuth), WaveTube eliminates the need for users to remember multiple passwords or undergo cumbersome registration processes, thus makes it possible for the masses of web2 users to come to web3 smoothly and securely.


## Challenges and Overcoming Them:
- **Learning Curve with SUI and Move Programming Language:** As Apillon is a new platform, I faced a steep learning curve. Through thorough research, studying documentation, watching tutorial videos, and collaborating closely, Eventually i overcame these challenges and successfully implemented the project.
- **Integration Hurdles:** Integrating Apillon Storage, OAuth required meticulous planning and execution. I resolved various bugs and ensured seamless integration through iterative testing and leveraging community support.
